* autodeps:
    * minimal versions for shared objects
    * configurable ?

* checks:
    * progs
    * some standard tools ? --> msgfmt

* features
    * write to config(s)
    * dependencies

* packaging:
    - clean duplicate dependencies (drop w/o versions and keep w/ versions)
    - deps w/ versions to internal packages (maybe w/ minver attr ?)

* debian:
    * automatic docs + copyright + changelog
    * dh_installchangelogs
    * dh_shlibdeps --> write and process shlibdeps files ?

* arch independent pkgconfig
